# Sky Vaulters Support
For the modpack "Vault Hunters S3" by Iskall85, this mod provides a server utility that enables multiplayer island generation and protection.
This mod can be used without changing the client-side modpack, the mod can be installed within the server mods to use.  
  
The mod has high customization ability for the protections of your island, this allows for co-op's without requiring you to be part of the other players island. The mod does NOT protect dimensional portals from being entered, I.E. Netherportal, Vaultportal, ...

## Mod Information
Every island has a size of 800x800 blocks, these islands are generated within a void world. To keep this a void world the mod terralith is required to be removed from server mod files. (Client does not need to remove the mod, or add this one). The default island that is spawned is the one provided by the modpack 'Vault Hunters 3rd Edition'.  
  
You can interact with this server-sided mod through several commands, and through the GUI. The mod commands do not cover all possibilitys that are able to be done with the mod, the GUI does cover all possibilities. 
  
This mod can be seen in use on: vh3.yorickblom.nl.
